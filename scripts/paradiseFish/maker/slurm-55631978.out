  /!\ For features where both are missing A single Level2 features (e.g. mRNA) and a single level1 (e.g. gene) will be created by AGAT, and all level3 feautres (e,g, CDS,exon) will be attached to them. This is probably not what you want...
  see B. 2.2 and 3. at https://agat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/agat_how_does_it_work.html 
  /!\ For features where the common attribute or the parent attribute is missing, it would be fine as long as you do not expect isoforms in your annotation (Eukaryote).  see B. 4. at https://agat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/agat_how_does_it_work.html 
  !! You might try to fix the issue by choosing a common tag attribute to use in order to group the features correctly (parameter --ct in agat_convert_sp_gxf2gxf.pl).
